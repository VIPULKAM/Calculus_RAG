# Compound interest and e (part 4) | Exponential and logarithmic functions | Algebra II | Khan Academy

*Source: [Khan Academy Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxHMTJRhmY)*

## Key Concepts
- Continuous compound interest formula
- Applying the formula for different time periods
- Solving for unknown variables in compound interest problems
- Relationship between exponential functions and logarithms

## Definitions
- **Continuous compounding**: Interest calculated and added to the principal continuously (infinitely many times per period)
- **Principal (P)**: Initial amount borrowed or invested
- **Interest rate (r)**: Annual rate expressed as a decimal
- **Time (t)**: Number of years
- **Compound interest formula**: $A = Pe^{rt}$
  - Where $A$ = final amount, $P$ = principal, $r$ = interest rate, $t$ = time

## Examples & Steps

### Example 1: Calculating final amount
**Problem**: Borrow $1,000 at 25% annual interest for 3 years with continuous compounding. How much is owed?

**Solution**:
1. Identify values: $P = 1000$, $r = 0.25$, $t = 3$
2. Apply formula: $A = 1000 \cdot e^{0.25 \cdot 3}$
3. Calculate exponent: $0.25 \cdot 3 = 0.75$
4. Compute: $A = 1000 \cdot e^{0.75} ≈ 1000 \cdot 2.117 = \$2,117$

### Example 2: Finding the interest rate
**Problem**: $50 grows to $500 after 10 years with continuous compounding. What was the interest rate?

**Solution**:
1. Set up equation: $50 \cdot e^{r \cdot 10} = 500$
2. Divide both sides by 50: $e^{10r} = 10$
3. Take natural log of both sides: $\ln(e^{10r}) = \ln(10)$
4. Simplify: $10r = \ln(10) ≈ 2.3026$
5. Solve for r: $r = 2.3026 ÷ 10 = 0.23026$ or **23.03%**

## Summary
This lesson teaches the continuous compound interest formula $A = Pe^{rt}$, which calculates how money grows when interest is compounded infinitely often. The formula can be used to find the final amount, or to solve for unknown variables like the interest rate using logarithms. Continuous compounding demonstrates how even moderate interest rates can lead to significant growth over time.
