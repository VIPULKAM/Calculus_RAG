# Function inverse example 1 | Functions and their graphs | Algebra II | Khan Academy

*Source: [Khan Academy Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSiamij_i_k)*

## Key Concepts
- Finding the inverse of a function algebraically
- Graphing inverse functions
- Understanding the relationship between a function and its inverse as reflections over the line $y = x$
- Verifying inverse functions using input-output pairs

## Definitions
- **Inverse Function**: A function that reverses the mapping of the original function. If $f(a) = b$, then $f^{-1}(b) = a$.
- **Reflection over $y = x$**: The graph of an inverse function is the reflection of the original function’s graph over the line $y = x$.

## Examples & Steps

### Example 1: Linear Function
**Function:** $f(x) = -x + 4$

**Step 1:** Set $y = f(x)$  
$y = -x + 4$

**Step 2:** Solve for $x$ in terms of $y$  
$y - 4 = -x$  
Multiply by $-1$: $-y + 4 = x$  
So, $x = -y + 4$

**Step 3:** Write the inverse function  
$f^{-1}(y) = -y + 4$  
Rename $y$ as $x$:  
$f^{-1}(x) = -x + 4$

**Observation:** The function is its own inverse. The graph of $f(x)$ and $f^{-1}(x)$ are identical because the line $y = -x + 4$ is perpendicular to $y = x$, so reflecting it over $y = x$ gives the same line.

**Verification:**  
- $f(5) = -1$ and $f^{-1}(-1) = 5$  
- $f(4) = 0$ and $f^{-1}(0) = 4$

### Example 2: Another Linear Function
**Function:** $g(x) = -2x - 1$

**Step 1:** Set $y = g(x)$  
$y = -2x - 1$

**Step 2:** Solve for $x$ in terms of $y$  
$y + 1 = -2x$  
Divide by $-2$: $x = -\frac{y}{2} - \frac{1}{2}$

**Step 3:** Write the inverse function  
$g^{-1}(y) = -\frac{y}{2} - \frac{1}{2}$  
Rename $y$ as $x$:  
$g^{-1}(x) = -\frac{x}{2} - \frac{1}{2}$

**Graphing:**  
- $g(x)$ has slope $-2$, $y$-intercept $-1$  
- $g^{-1}(x)$ has slope $-\frac{1}{2}$, $y$-intercept $-\frac{1}{2}$  
- The two graphs are reflections over the line $y = x$

## Summary
To find the inverse of a function, solve the equation $y = f(x)$ for $x$ in terms of $y$, then rename the variable to express the inverse as $f^{-1}(x)$. The graph of an inverse function is the reflection of the original function over the line $y = x$, which can be verified by checking that input-output pairs are reversed.
