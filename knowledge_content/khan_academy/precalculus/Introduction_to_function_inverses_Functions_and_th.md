# Introduction to function inverses | Functions and their graphs | Algebra II | Khan Academy

*Source: [Khan Academy Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W84lObmOp8M)*

## Key Concepts
- Understanding what a function does: mapping inputs to outputs
- The concept of an inverse function: reversing the mapping
- How to algebraically find the inverse of a function
- Graphical relationship between a function and its inverse

## Definitions
- **Function**: A mapping from a set of inputs (domain) to a set of outputs (range)
- **Inverse function**: A function that reverses the mapping of the original function. If $f$ maps $a$ to $b$, then $f^{-1}$ maps $b$ to $a$
- Notation: The inverse of $f(x)$ is written as $f^{-1}(x)$

## Examples & Steps

### Finding the Inverse of $f(x) = 2x + 4$

**Step 1:** Start with the original function
$$y = 2x + 4$$

**Step 2:** Solve for $x$ in terms of $y$
- Subtract 4 from both sides: $y - 4 = 2x$
- Divide both sides by 2: $\frac{y}{2} - 2 = x$

**Step 3:** Express as inverse function
$$f^{-1}(y) = \frac{1}{2}y - 2$$

**Step 4:** Rename variables (swap $x$ and $y$)
$$f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1}{2}x - 2$$

### Verifying the Inverse
- Original function: $f(2) = 2(2) + 4 = 8$
- Inverse function: $f^{-1}(8) = \frac{1}{2}(8) - 2 = 2$
- The inverse successfully returns us to the original input

### Graphical Relationship
- The graphs of $f(x)$ and $f^{-1}(x)$ are symmetric about the line $y = x$
- Example point: $f(0) = 4$ and $f^{-1}(4) = 0$ show this reflection

## Summary
This lesson introduced inverse functions as operations that reverse the mapping of original functions. The inverse can be found algebraically by solving the equation for $x$ in terms of $y$, then swapping the variables. Graphically, a function and its inverse are reflections across the line $y = x$, demonstrating how they undo each other's operations.
