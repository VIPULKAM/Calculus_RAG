## Key Concepts
- **Simple Interest:** Interest calculated only on the initial amount borrowed (the principal).
- **Compound Interest:** Interest calculated on the initial principal *and also* on the accumulated interest from previous periods.
- **Compounding Frequency:** How often interest is calculated and added to the principal (e.g., annually, semi-annually, monthly, daily).
- **Effective Annual Rate:** The actual interest rate earned or paid in a year, considering the effect of compounding.

## Definitions
- **Principal ($P$):** The initial amount of money borrowed or invested.
- **Annual Interest Rate ($r$):** The percentage of the principal charged as interest over one year. In the video, $r = 100\% = 1.00$.
- **Compounding Periods ($n$):** The number of times per year that interest is compounded.
- **Amount Owed ($A$):** The total amount to be paid back, including the principal and all compounded interest. The general formula introduced is:
  $A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^n$

## Examples & Steps

### Example 1: Annual Compounding (Simple Interest)
- **Scenario:** Borrow $1.00 at 100% annual interest for 1 year, compounded once.
- **Calculation:**
    - Principal, $P = \$1.00$
    - Annual Rate, $r = 100\% = 1.00$
    - Periods, $n = 1$
    - Amount Owed: $A = 1 \times (1 + \frac{1}{1})^1 = 1 \times (2)^1 = \$2.00$
- **Explanation:** You pay back the $1.00 principal plus $1.00 in interest.

### Example 2: Semi-Annual Compounding
- **Scenario:** Borrow $1.00 at 100% annual interest, compounded every 6 months.
- **Calculation:**
    1.  **After 6 months:** Interest for the period is $\frac{100\%}{2} = 50\%$.
        Amount owed: $1.00 + (1.00 \times 0.50) = \$1.50$. This becomes the new principal.
    2.  **After 12 months:** Interest is calculated on the new principal of $1.50$.
        Interest: $1.50 \times 0.50 = \$0.75$.
        Final Amount Owed: $1.50 + 0.75 = \$2.25$.
- **Using the Formula:**
    - $P = 1$, $r = 1.00$, $n = 2$
    - $A = 1 \times (1 + \frac{1}{2})^2 = 1 \times (1.5)^2 = \$2.25$
- **Effective Annual Rate:** You paid $1.25 in interest on a $1.00 loan, which is a 125% effective annual rate.

### Example 3: Monthly Compounding
- **Scenario:** Borrow $1.00 at 100% annual interest, compounded every month.
- **Calculation using the formula:**
    - $P = 1$, $r = 1.00$, $n = 12$
    - Monthly Rate: $\frac{100\%}{12} \approx 8.333\%$ (video uses 8.5% as an approximation).
    - $A = 1 \times (1 + \frac{1}{12})^{12} \approx 1 \times (1.08333)^{12} \approx \$2.61$ (Video calculation with 8.5% was \$2.66).
- **Effective Annual Rate:** The effective rate is approximately 161% (or 166% with the video's approximation).

## Summary
This lesson introduces compound interest, where interest is earned on both the initial principal and previously accumulated interest. The key takeaway is that increasing the number of compounding periods ($n$) within a year increases the total amount owed, leading to a higher effective annual interest rate than the stated annual rate. The general formula $A = P(1 + \frac{r}{n})^n$ is used to calculate the final amount.
