# Binomial Theorem (part 2)

*Source: [Khan Academy Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fFWWt1m9k0)*

## Key Concepts
- Binomial Theorem: A formula for expanding expressions of the form $(a + b)^n$
- Pascal's Triangle: A triangular array of numbers used to find binomial coefficients quickly
- Efficient Methods: Faster ways to compute binomial expansions without direct multiplication

## Definitions
- **Binomial Theorem**: $(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$
- **Binomial Coefficient**: $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, represents the number of ways to choose k items from n
- **Pascal's Triangle**: A pattern where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it, providing binomial coefficients

## Examples & Steps

### Using Pascal's Triangle
**Example**: Expand $(a + b)^4$

**Steps**:
1. Build Pascal's Triangle up to row 4:
   ```
   Row 0:       1
   Row 1:      1 1
   Row 2:     1 2 1
   Row 3:    1 3 3 1
   Row 4:   1 4 6 4 1
   ```
2. Use coefficients from row 4: 1, 4, 6, 4, 1
3. Apply pattern of decreasing a's and increasing b's:
   $(a + b)^4 = 1a^4b^0 + 4a^3b^1 + 6a^2b^2 + 4a^1b^3 + 1a^0b^4$
4. Simplify: $a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4$

### Fast Coefficient Method for $(x + y)^{10}$
**Steps**:
1. Write term numbers 1 through 11 (since n=10 gives 11 terms)
2. Pattern exponents: x decreases from 10 to 0, y increases from 0 to 10
3. Compute coefficients using this trick:
   - First coefficient: 1
   - Multiply by n and divide by term number for subsequent coefficients:
     - Term 2: $1 \times 10 / 1 = 10$
     - Term 3: $10 \times 9 / 2 = 45$
     - Term 4: $45 \times 8 / 3 = 120$
     - Continue pattern until coefficients are found

## Summary
The video showed how Pascal's Triangle provides a visual method for finding binomial coefficients quickly. It also introduced an even faster computational method where coefficients are generated by multiplying and dividing sequentially. These techniques make expanding high-power binomials practical without tedious multiplication.
