# Complex conjugates | Imaginary and complex numbers | Precalculus | Khan Academy

*Source: [Khan Academy Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZxZ_eEuJBM)*

## Key Concepts
- Clarification of the real and imaginary parts of a complex number
- Definition and geometric interpretation of the complex conjugate
- How to use the conjugate to simplify division of complex numbers

## Definitions
- **Complex Number**: A number of the form $z = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit ($i^2 = -1$).
- **Real Part**: The real number $a$ in $z = a + bi$. Denoted as $\text{Re}(z)$.
- **Imaginary Part**: The real number $b$ in $z = a + bi$. Denoted as $\text{Im}(z)$.
- **Complex Conjugate**: For $z = a + bi$, the conjugate is $\bar{z} = a - bi$.
- **Product of a Complex Number and its Conjugate**: $z \cdot \bar{z} = (a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 + b^2$, which is always a real number.

## Examples & Steps
**Example: Dividing Complex Numbers Using the Conjugate**

Simplify: $\frac{1 + 2i}{4 - 5i}$

**Step 1:** Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator ($4 + 5i$):
\[
\frac{1 + 2i}{4 - 5i} \cdot \frac{4 + 5i}{4 + 5i}
\]

**Step 2:** Expand the numerator:
\[
(1 + 2i)(4 + 5i) = 1(4) + 1(5i) + 2i(4) + 2i(5i) = 4 + 5i + 8i + 10i^2
\]
Since $i^2 = -1$, this becomes:
\[
4 + 13i - 10 = -6 + 13i
\]

**Step 3:** Expand the denominator:
\[
(4 - 5i)(4 + 5i) = 4^2 - (5i)^2 = 16 - 25i^2
\]
Since $i^2 = -1$, this becomes:
\[
16 + 25 = 41
\]

**Step 4:** Combine results:
\[
\frac{-6 + 13i}{41} = -\frac{6}{41} + \frac{13}{41}i
\]

## Summary
This lesson clarified the formal definitions of the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It introduced the complex conjugate, which is the reflection of a complex number over the real axis, and demonstrated how multiplying a complex number by its conjugate yields a real number. This property is especially useful for simplifying the division of complex numbers by eliminating the imaginary part from the denominator.
