# Interest (part 2) | Interest and debt | Finance & Capital Markets | Khan Academy

*Source: [Khan Academy Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4zfiBw0hwM)*

## Key Concepts
- Simple interest: interest calculated only on the initial principal amount
- Compound interest: interest calculated on the initial principal plus accumulated interest
- Comparing simple vs. compound interest over time
- Deriving formulas for future value using both methods

## Definitions
- **Principal ($P$):** The initial amount of money borrowed or invested
- **Interest rate ($r$):** The percentage charged on the principal (written as 100r%)
- **Time ($t$):** The number of years the money is borrowed/invested
- **Simple interest formula:**  
  Future value = $P(1 + rt)$
- **Compound interest formula:**  
  Future value = $P(1 + r)^t$

## Examples & Steps
**Simple Interest Example:**
- Borrow $50 at 15% simple interest for 20 years
- Step 1: Convert rate to decimal: $r = 0.15$
- Step 2: Apply formula: $50(1 + 0.15 \times 20)$
- Step 3: Calculate: $50(1 + 3) = 50 \times 4 = \$200$

**Compound Interest Example:**
- Same parameters: $50 at 15% compound interest for 20 years
- Step 1: Apply formula: $50(1 + 0.15)^{20}$
- Step 2: Calculate exponent: $1.15^{20} \approx 16.37$
- Step 3: Multiply: $50 \times 16.37 = \$818.50$

**Comparison:**
- Simple interest: Final amount = $200
- Compound interest: Final amount = $818.50
- Difference: $818.50 - $200 = $618.50 more with compounding

## Summary
This lesson explains how to calculate future values using simple and compound interest formulas. Simple interest grows linearly by adding fixed interest each year ($P(1 + rt)$), while compound interest grows exponentially by multiplying by $(1 + r)$ each year ($P(1 + r)^t$). Compound interest results in significantly higher amounts over long periods compared to simple interest at the same rate.
