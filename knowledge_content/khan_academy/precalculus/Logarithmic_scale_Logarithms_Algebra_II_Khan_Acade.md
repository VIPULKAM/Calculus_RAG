# Logarithmic scale | Logarithms | Algebra II | Khan Academy

*Source: [Khan Academy Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBhEi4L91Sg)*

## Key Concepts
- Linear scales: traditional number lines where equal distances represent adding/subtracting a fixed amount
- Logarithmic scales: number lines where equal distances represent multiplying/dividing by a fixed factor
- Relationship between logarithmic scales and exponents
- How to plot numbers on logarithmic scales using logarithms

## Definitions
- **Linear scale**: A scale where moving a fixed distance corresponds to adding or subtracting a constant value
- **Logarithmic scale**: A scale where moving a fixed distance corresponds to multiplying or dividing by a constant factor
- **Logarithm**: The exponent to which a base must be raised to produce a given number
  - Notation: $\log_{10}(x)$ means "10 to what power equals x?"
  - Example: $\log_{10}(100) = 2$ because $10^2 = 100$

## Examples & Steps

### Example 1: Plotting 100 on a logarithmic scale
1. Start at 1 on the logarithmic number line
2. Ask: "10 to what power equals 100?" → $\log_{10}(100) = 2$
3. Move 2 fixed distances to the right (each distance represents ×10)
4. Plot 100 at this location

### Example 2: Plotting 2 on a logarithmic scale
1. Calculate $\log_{10}(2) ≈ 0.301$
2. Start at 1 on the logarithmic number line
3. Move 0.301 of the fixed distance to the right
4. Plot 2 at this location (about 1/3 of the way to 10)

### Example 3: Pattern on logarithmic scale
- From 1: move one distance right → 10 (×10)
- Move another distance right → 100 (×10 again, total ×100)
- From 1: move one distance left → 0.1 (÷10)
- Move another distance left → 0.01 (÷10 again, total ÷100)

## Summary
Logarithmic scales use multiplication/division instead of addition/subtraction for equal distances. This allows us to represent a much wider range of values compactly. The position of any number on a logarithmic scale can be determined using logarithms, which tell us what power of the base equals that number.
