# Function inverses example 2 | Functions and their graphs | Algebra II | Khan Academy

*Source: [Khan Academy Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeyFb2eVH1c)*

## Key Concepts
- Finding the inverse of a quadratic function by restricting the domain
- Solving for the inverse by switching variables and solving for the new dependent variable
- Understanding the relationship between the domain of a function and the range of its inverse
- Graphing inverse functions and their symmetry about the line $y = x$

## Definitions
- **Inverse Function**: A function that "reverses" another function. If $f$ maps $x$ to $y$, then $f^{-1}$ maps $y$ back to $x$.
- **Domain Restriction**: Limiting the input values of a function so that it becomes one-to-one and an inverse can be found.

## Examples & Steps
**Problem:** Find the inverse of $f(x) = (x + 2)^2 + 1$, where $x \geq -2$.

**Step 1 – Write the function in terms of $y$**
\[
y = (x + 2)^2 + 1
\]

**Step 2 – Solve for $x$ in terms of $y$**
- Subtract 1 from both sides:
  \[
  y - 1 = (x + 2)^2
  \]
- Take the square root of both sides. Since $x \geq -2$, $x + 2 \geq 0$, so we take the positive square root:
  \[
  \sqrt{y - 1} = x + 2
  \]
- Subtract 2:
  \[
  x = \sqrt{y - 1} - 2
  \]

**Step 3 – Determine the domain of the inverse**
- The original function has domain $x \geq -2$ and range $y \geq 1$.
- The inverse function will have domain $y \geq 1$ (the range of the original) and range $x \geq -2$ (the domain of the original).

**Step 4 – Write the inverse function**
- In terms of $y$:
  \[
  f^{-1}(y) = \sqrt{y - 1} - 2, \quad \text{for } y \geq 1
  \]
- Rename $y$ to $x$ for the final answer:
  \[
  f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x - 1} - 2, \quad \text{for } x \geq 1
  \]

**Step 5 – Graph the inverse**
- Key points: $(1, -2)$, $(2, -1)$, $(5, 0)$
- The graph of $f(x)$ and $f^{-1}(x)$ are symmetric about the line $y = x$.

## Summary
This lesson showed how to find the inverse of a quadratic function by restricting its domain to make it one-to-one. The process involves solving for $x$, swapping variables, and considering domain and range restrictions. The graphs of a function and its inverse are mirror images across the line $y = x$.
