# Introduction to interest | Interest and debt | Finance & Capital Markets | Khan Academy

*Source: [Khan Academy Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtaoP0skPWc)*

## Key Concepts
- What interest is and why it exists
- Simple interest calculation
- Compound interest calculation
- Comparing simple vs. compound interest over time

## Definitions
- **Interest**: The "rent" paid for borrowing money. If you borrow money, you pay back the original amount plus an extra fee called interest.
- **Principal**: The original amount of money borrowed (denoted as $P$).
- **Interest Rate**: The percentage of the principal charged as interest per time period (denoted as $r$).
- **Simple Interest**: Interest calculated only on the original principal each period.
  - Formula for amount owed after $t$ years: $A = P + (P \times r \times t)$
- **Compound Interest**: Interest calculated on the principal plus previously accumulated interest each period.
  - Formula for amount owed after $t$ years: $A = P \times (1 + r)^t$

## Examples & Steps

### Simple Interest Example
**Scenario**: Borrow $100 at 10% simple interest per year for 10 years.

**Step-by-step calculation**:
- Year 0: Owe $100
- Year 1: $100 + (10\% \times 100) = 100 + 10 = 110$
- Year 2: $100 + (10\% \times 100 \times 2) = 100 + 20 = 120$
- Year 3: $100 + (10\% \times 100 \times 3) = 100 + 30 = 130$
- ...
- Year 10: $100 + (10\% \times 100 \times 10) = 100 + 100 = 200$

**Final amount**: $200

### Compound Interest Example
**Scenario**: Borrow $100 at 10% compound interest per year for 10 years.

**Step-by-step calculation**:
- Year 0: $100
- Year 1: $100 \times 1.1 = 110$
- Year 2: $110 \times 1.1 = 121$ or $100 \times (1.1)^2 = 121$
- Year 3: $121 \times 1.1 = 133.10$ or $100 \times (1.1)^3 ≈ 133.10$
- ...
- Year 10: $100 \times (1.1)^{10} ≈ 259.37$

**Final amount**: $259.37

## Summary
Interest is the fee paid for borrowing money, calculated as a percentage of the principal. Simple interest is calculated only on the original amount each year, while compound interest is calculated on the growing balance (principal + accumulated interest). Over time, compound interest results in significantly higher amounts owed compared to simple interest at the same rate.
