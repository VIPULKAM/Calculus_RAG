# Parametric equations 1 | Parametric equations and polar coordinates | Precalculus | Khan Academy

*Source: [Khan Academy Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6c6dlmUT1c)*

## Key Concepts
- Parametric equations: describing motion using a third parameter (time)
- Projectile motion: modeling the path of an object under gravity
- Relationship between parametric equations and graphs

## Definitions
- **Parametric Equations**: Equations where x and y are defined in terms of a third variable (parameter)
  - Example: $x = f(t)$, $y = g(t)$
- **Parameter**: An independent variable (often time $t$) that defines both x and y coordinates

## Examples & Steps

### Car Falling Off Cliff Problem
**Given**: 
- Cliff height: 50 m (y = 50 at start)
- Starting x-position: 10 m
- Horizontal velocity: 5 m/s
- Gravity: 10 m/s² downward

**Parametric Equations**:
- Horizontal motion: $x(t) = 5t + 10$
- Vertical motion: $y(t) = 50 - 5t^2$

**Step-by-Step Calculation**:

| Time (t) | x(t) = 5t + 10 | y(t) = 50 - 5t² |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| 0       | 10             | 50              |
| 1       | 15             | 45              |
| 2       | 20             | 30              |
| 3       | 25             | 5               |

**Graph Interpretation**:
- Points plotted: (10,50), (15,45), (20,30), (25,5)
- Path forms a downward-opening parabola
- Direction: as t increases, car moves right and downward

## Summary
Parametric equations allow us to describe motion by expressing x and y coordinates separately as functions of time. This example showed how to model projectile motion using parametric equations, revealing both the path (a parabola) and the direction of movement. The parameter t provides additional information about position at specific times that wouldn't be available from the graph alone.
