# Squeeze theorem (sandwich theorem) | Limits | Differential Calculus | Khan Academy

*Source: [Khan Academy Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igJdDN-DPgA)*

## Key Concepts
- The Squeeze Theorem (Sandwich Theorem)
- Using the Squeeze Theorem to prove the limit of $\frac{\sin x}{x}$ as $x$ approaches 0

## Definitions
- **Squeeze Theorem**: If $g(x) \leq f(x) \leq h(x)$ for all $x$ near $a$ (except possibly at $a$), and $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = \lim_{x \to a} h(x) = L$, then $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$.

## Examples & Steps
### Intuitive Example (Calorie Analogy)
- Sal always eats more than (or equal to) Umama: $\text{Umama} \leq \text{Sal}$
- Sal always eats less than (or equal to) Bill: $\text{Sal} \leq \text{Bill}$
- On Tuesday: $\text{Umama} = 300$ and $\text{Bill} = 300$
- Therefore, $\text{Sal} = 300$

### Graphical Example
- Let $g(x)$ (lower function) and $h(x)$ (upper function) both approach $L$ as $x \to a$
- If $f(x)$ is always between $g(x)$ and $h(x)$, then $f(x)$ must also approach $L$ as $x \to a$

## Summary
The Squeeze Theorem states that if a function is bounded between two other functions that approach the same limit at a point, then the middle function must also approach that limit. This theorem will be used in the next video to prove that $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$, a key limit in calculus.
